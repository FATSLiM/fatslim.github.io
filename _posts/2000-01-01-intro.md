**Important note:** FATSLiM is not developed anymore. *This website is an archive.*

FATSLiM stands for "**F**ast **A**nalysis **T**oolbox for **S**imulations of **Li**pid **M**embranes" and its goal is to
provide an efficient, yet robust, tool to extract physical parameters from MD trajectories.

The main objective of FATSLiM is to decrease as possible the amount of time needed to
analyze MD trajectories: the ultimate goal is to process a several-gigabyte-big file is just a
few minutes or less. This is why a rather important part of FATSLiM's development is
focused on code optimization and simplification in order to maximize its efficiency.

### Features

- **Membrane morphology agnostic.** FATSLiM can handle planar membrane as well as highly distorted bilayers or even 
vesicles!
- **Force field independent.** FATSLiM can work with fully atomistic force fields like 
[Slipids](http://mmkluster.fos.su.se/slipids)
as well as with coarse grain ones like [Martini](http://md.chem.rug.nl/).
- **Automated Leaflet identification.** If you just need to identify which leaflet each lipid belongs to, no problem!
FATSLiM will do it for you.
- **Protein compatible.** You have one or several proteins embedded in your lipid membrane. Fear not! FATSLiM can handle
them just fine.
- **Bilayer Thickness.** Your membrane oscillates so you are not sure how to get your membrane thickness?
FATSLiM is there for you.
- **Area per lipid and membrane area.** You have a beautiful vesicle and want to see how the area per lipid changes
between the inner and the outer leaflet? FATSLiM can help you... Of course, it can also help you with flat membranes too.
- **Fast and frugal.** FATSLiM is designed to be fast while not being a memory hog. Let's take a 16GB big 
trajectory (40K frames) consisting primarily of 512 lipids and ~31K water molecules.
The `gmx check` utilities will need 7 min 16s and 12.9 MB of RAM to read the whole trajectory where
 FATSLiM will need 8 min 40s and 32.5 MB to analyze the trajectory and plot the thickness along the 40K frames.
- **Computationally efficient.** FATSLiM scales linearly with the number of lipids for both execution time and memory.
  Typically for a 100-frame trajectory containing with 12000+ lipids, analysis will take less than 1 second and will 
  need less than 256 MB of RAM. 
- **Open-source.** In order to maximize collaboration and ease enhancements, FATSLiM is released under the [GNU General Public License, version 3](https://github.com/FATSLiM/fatslim/blob/master/LICENSE), meaning that you can access and modify the source code freely.
