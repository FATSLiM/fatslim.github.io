# Requirements

FATSLiM is written in Python and, consequently, a **Python environment with header files** is required. FATSLiM is tested
 and should be working with Python **2.7 to 3.5**. FATSLiM only depends on [**NumPy**](http://www.numpy.org/), but, 
 if you want to run the tests (recommended), [pytest](http://pytest.org/) is also needed.
 
Computationally intensive tasks are written in Cython. [Cython](http://cython.org/) is not a requirement *per se* 
as C-translated code is provided but the latest version of Cython is recommended.

Finally, a C compiler is required with openMP enabled if you want parallelism.

# Installation

## From [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fatslim)

FATSLiM can be installed using pip via the following command:

~~~
pip install fatslim
~~~

## From [Github](https://github.com/FATSLiM/fatslim)

Alternatively, installation of the development version can be done directly from the 
[git repository](https://github.com/FATSLiM/fatslim) by, first, cloning the repo:

~~~
git clone https://github.com/FATSLiM/fatslim.git
~~~

Followed by `setup.py install`:

~~~
cd fatslim/
python setup.py install
~~~

## Check installation

Once the installation is done, it is a good idea to run the `self-test` command to make sure that everything is OK:

~~~
fatslim self-test
~~~
