# How to use FATSLiM?

FATSLiM is designed to be called using the command line, in a very similar manner as one would use
[git](https://git-scm.com/) or [GROMACS](http://www.gromacs.org/) 5.x 
(*i.e* after the introduction of the global `gmx` command): using FATSLiM is done by specifying a command to the global
executable `fatslim`.

## Getting help

To display the general help (and the list of available FATSLiM commands):

~~~
fatslim help
~~~

To get help for a specific command, there are two alternatives:

1. Using the help command:

~~~
fatslim help <command>
~~~

2. Using the `--help` flag (or the short alternative `-h`):

~~~
fatslim <command> --help
~~~


## What do you need?

To run FATSLiM and perform analysis on your MD trajectory, you will need **two** or (most probably) **three** files:

* a `configuration` file used to get atom names and residues (*i.e.* a poor-man version of the topology).
The associated option is `--conf` (short alternative: `-c`).
Currently, only [`.gro`](http://manual.gromacs.org/current/online/gro.html) files are supported.

* an `index` file used to specify the atoms to be used as references fot he lipids head groups.
The associated option is `--index` (short alternative: `-n`).
Currently, only [`.ndx`](http://manual.gromacs.org/current/online/ndx.html) files are supported.

* an `trajectory` file that contains the coordinates.
The associated option is `--trajectory` (short alternative: `-t`).
Currently, [`.trr`](http://manual.gromacs.org/current/online/trr.html) and 
[`.xtc`](http://manual.gromacs.org/current/online/xtc.html) files are supported. Please note that this file is optional
as, if not provided, the coordinates from the `configuration` file will be used.

As you can see, the only file that is not required nor provided by GROMACS itself is the `index` file that you have to 
generate thanks to [`gmx make_ndx`](http://manual.gromacs.org/current/programs/gmx-make_ndx.html) for example.
This `index` file must contain at least one atom group that FATSLiM will used as reference to identify lipid head groups.

Note 1: The name of the index group to use for head groups can be specified by changing the value of the 
`--hg-group` option (by default the name "headgroups" is used).

Note 2: The index group can contain more than one atoms from the same residue. In this case, the center of geometry 
from the atoms will be used. It is then possible to used one atoms, one or even several moieties
(*e.g.* phosphate + choline) as reference beads.

## Examples

Here are just a few examples of what FATSLiM can do.

- Identify membranes and save the leaflets as atom groups:

~~~
fatslim membranes -c conf.gro -t traj.xtc -n index.ndx --output-index leaflets.ndx
~~~

- Retrieve membrane thickness and plot the calculated thickness along the trajectory:

~~~
fatslim thickness -c conf.gro -t traj.xtc -n index.ndx --plot-thickness thickness.xvg
~~~

Please note that `conf.gro` and `index.ndx` are the default name for the `configuration` and the `index` file, respectively, and 
may be omitted:

~~~
fatslim thickness -t traj.xtc --plot-thickness thickness.xvg
~~~

- FATSLiM is parallelized thanks to [OpenMP](http://openmp.org/) and will used all the available ressources by default 
but you can specify the number of threads to use via the `--nthreads` option:

~~~
fatslim thickness -t traj.xtc --plot-thickness thickness.xvg --nthreads 4
~~~

- For each membrane property (thickness, area per lipid), raw values (*i.e.* calculated values for every single lipid) 
can be exported to [`.csv`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) files (one per trajectory frame).
Here is an example for the area per lipid:

~~~
fatslim apl -t traj.xtc --export-apl-raw apl_raw.csv
~~~
